video-textures-opencv
=====================

This project is an OpenCV implementation of Video Textures.  This has been
successfully tested on Mac OS 10.6 and Debian-flavored linux.  There are bash
build scripts included for each of the platforms, but the OpenCV include and
linking paths may need to be changed for non-typical installations.  This can
be used with any image file format supported by the OpenCV backend.  1000
samples and sigma equal to 0.01 were values that can be used for testing.  This
is released under the MIT license.  Any comments can be directed to
